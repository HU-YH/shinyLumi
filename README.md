# shinyLumi

## Description

The goal of shinyLumi is to build an easy-to-use plotting tool for **MethylumiSet** class,which represent methylation arrary data, from **methylumi** packag, like how **shinyMethyl** packages works for **RGChannelSet** class from **minfi** package. 

## Installation

For this in-development version of this package, you need all 3 packages mentioned above(**shinyMethyl**, **minfi** and **methylumi**) to make the package work.

## Example



## Future Plan

For those classmates who are assigned this package for review part of BCB410: Sorry for this over-simplifed package which result in wasting your time reviewing its code. Though this function can run and produce expected result, it's not in the way I plan. For planned finalized version, **MethylumiSet** objects are supposed to be able to convert to **shinyMethylSet** directly without **rgChannelSet** intermediate.
